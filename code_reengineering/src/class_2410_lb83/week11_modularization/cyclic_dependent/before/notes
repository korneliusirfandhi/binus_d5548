Option 1: Introduce an interface for one of the abstractions involved in the cycle.

Option 2: In case one of the dependencies is unnecessary and can be safely removed, then remove that dependency. For instance, apply “move method” (and “move field”) refactoring to move the code that introduces cyclic dependency to one of the participating abstractions.

Option 3: Move the code that introduces cyclic dependency to an altogether different abstraction.

Option 4: In case the abstractions involved in the cycle represent a semantically single object, merge the abstractions into a single abstraction.
